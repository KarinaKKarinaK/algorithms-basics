# BUBBLE SORT
import time
# How it works:

# 1. Go through the array, one value at a time.
# 2. For each value, compare the value with the next value.
# 3. If the value is higher than the next one, swap the values so that the highest value comes last.
# 4. Go through the array as many times as there are values in the array.

            if list[j] > list[j + 1]:
                list[j], list[j+1] = list[j+1], list[j]
