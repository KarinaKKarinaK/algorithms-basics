# QUICK SORT
import time
# How it works:

# 1. Choose a value in the array to be the pivot element.
# 2. rder the rest of the array so that lower values than the pivot element are on the left, and higher values are on the right.
# 3. Swap the pivot element with the first element of the higher values so that the pivot element lands in between the lower and higher values.
# 4. Do the same operations (recursively) for the sub-arrays on the left and right side of the pivot element.
